# SolicitorSync

## 1. Brief description
SolicitorSync is a lightweight ASP.NET Core Web API that simulates a case management system. 
The API will allow users (e.g., internal staff) to manage legal cases or complaints related 
to solicitor conduct. This project demonstrates the ability to design RESTful APIs, interact 
with a database, and produce well-documented, high-quality codeâ€”all while using modern 
development practices.

## 2. Features 

### A) CRUD Operations:
1) Create: Add new legal cases or complaints.
2) Read: Retrieve a list of cases or a specific case by ID.
3) Update: Modify existing case details.
4) Delete: Remove cases that are no longer active.

### B) RESTful API Standards:
The project utilises RESTful API to implement proper HTTP methods, status codes, and routing 
conventions.

### C) Modular Design:
The project aims to structure the code with a clear separation of concerns (using Controllers, 
Services, Data Access Layers) to illustrate best practices in software architecture. This 
design will allow the developer to further expand its features and technical functionalities.

### D) Error Handling & Logging:
The project uses middleware for consistent error responses and integrates basic logging to 
capture key events or errors.

### E) Unit testing 
The project uses xUnit unit tests for the service layer to demonstrate adherence to the 
software development lifecycle and quality assurance practices.

### F) Data Persistence
The project uses PostgreSQL with the Dapper package to store case data.

## 3. TaskList

- [x] Create a GitHub repository. 
- [x] Download a model database and set it up in SQLite.
- [x] Create a connection string to the Database and test access using the program.cs.
- [x] Create a RESTful API with CRUD operations to manage case files. Implement routing and 
HTTP methods for Create, Update, Get, GetAll and Delete requests for the temporary database.
- [x] Create slug generation and slug-based retrieval method for Get request.
